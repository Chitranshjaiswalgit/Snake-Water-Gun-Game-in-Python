## Project Overview
The Snake, Water, Gun game implemented in Python allows a user to play against the computer. It's a simple hand game where choices (Snake, Water, Gun) determine the outcome based on predefined rules.


## Installation
This project requires Python 3.12.1 or later.
To set up the project:
1. Ensure Python 3.12.1 or a later version is installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
   - git clone <https://github.com/jaiswalchitransh/Snake-Water-Gun-Game-in-Python>
4. Open the project in your preferred Python environment (e.g., IDE or terminal).
5. Run the script (`game.py`) and observe the output.


## Usage
Ensure Python 3.x is installed. Run the script:

- python game.py
  
Follow the prompts to enter your choice (0 for Snake, 1 for Water, 2 for Gun) when prompted.


## Features
- **Random Selection**: The computer randomly selects its choice (Snake, Water, Gun).
- **Outcome Determination**: The game function compares the user's choice against the computer's choice and determines if the user won, lost, or it's a draw.
- **Score Representation**: Returns 0 for a draw, -1 for a loss, and 1 for a win.
- **User Interaction**: Provides clear feedback on the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the game result.
