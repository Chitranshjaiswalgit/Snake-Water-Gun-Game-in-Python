# Snake-Water-Gun-Game-in-Python

This Python script encapsulates the Snake, Water, Gun game, a classic hand game where a user competes against the computer. The game logic resides in the game function, which takes the computer's choice (comp) and the user's choice (user) as parameters. The function compares the choices and assigns a score: 0 for a draw, -1 for a loss, and 1 for a win.

Upon initiation, the program greets the player and randomly selects a choice for the computer (Snake, Water, or Gun). The user is then prompted to input their choice, and the game function is called to determine the outcome. The user's choice, the computer's choice, and the result are printed, indicating whether it's a draw, a win, or a loss for the user.

The game concludes with a "GAME OVER" message and an expression of gratitude for playing the Snake, Water, Gun Game. This script provides an interactive gaming experience, engaging users in a simple yet entertaining decision-making game against the computer.
